Garden full of life project. 

Stage one. Gather all necessary tools for the trade.
In this stage we will explore everything you will need to become successful front-end developer in the making. We will explore, research, 
download and learn to use all instruments, software, languages needed. At this point we will engage in simple but powerful exorcizes that 
will be ingrained in you so in the future you do not need to think about it just fire it up and engage in the project. All those will either be free 
or have small cost, but our goal is to minimize the expenditure of both the currencies and time and maximize the productivity level in this case your 
knowledge. Assume you will dedicate minimum 2 hours per day, 5 days a week. You still have other responsibilities, and you cannot hasten the knowledge. 
Slow and steady will do you good! I assume it will take us 3 months for you to be proficient with all the tasks and within 6 months you will have master then to a power user level.  Remember that to truly master languages such as c# it will take you years, but you do not need to become c# guru to produce very good code and that is our goal here.  Stage 2 will include all of these plus some other important technologies. After about a year you will have at least very good handle on technologies to become front end developer. After that we will decide what’s next.
All our correspondence and lessons will be in English.  It will serve dual purpose. Firstly it will force you to use your anglish skills on daily basis. 
Secondly it will improve both your understanding and mastery of technical jargon which is very important if you are dealing with the multinational community.
You can ask for explenation i Polish, Do not hesitate to do so and do not spent too much time researching individual words aor sentences. You will improve over time.
There is no better way of doint things but practice, practice practice. We will start with one excellen course that will touch on many topics we have to accomplish. Good luck.
